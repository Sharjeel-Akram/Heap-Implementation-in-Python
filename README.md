# Heap-Implementation-in-Python

1. Implement Max-Heap using list. Following functionsshould be part of the Max-Heap:

- insert_Value (to add an element in the Max-Heap) • Search_Value (to find whether given key is present in the Max-Heap or not?)
- delete_Value (to remove highest value from the Max-Heap)
- display_Heap (to print all the values present in the Max-Heap)

2. Implement Min-Heap using list. Following functions should be part of the Min-Heap:

- insert_Value (to add an element in the Min-Heap) • Search_Value (to find whether given key is present in the Min-Heap or not?)
- delete_Value (to remove lowest value from the Min-Heap)
- display_Heap (to print all the values present in the Min-Heap)
